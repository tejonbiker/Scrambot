PiDrive
This board designed to interface four motors with complete H-bridge, 
this task is accomplished with two L293 IC, some other sutff is addded,
like a PIC (MCU) to monitor the input voltage for the motors, the PIC is
not tested yet.

The board don't integrate a regulador to feed the Raspberry Pi with the
battery of the motors, this board only connect the battery for the motors.

The MPU6050 pinout works perfect.
